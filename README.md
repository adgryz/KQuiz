#### First team project in ReactNative

###Purpose
KQuiz is a quiz to play in same room with your friend.
The point of the game is to check how well you know eachother.
Game only works when you really meet in real world, so peopl will contact not only through internet

###Technologies
Whole game is serverless.
To store and update quizes we used Firebase.
To find other players and allow communication we used GoogleNearby - no game Ids and etc. needed :D !
